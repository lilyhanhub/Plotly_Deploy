# Plotly_Deploy
## Overview of the project
The purpose of the project is to create a dashboard to visualize the bacteria species dataset for a microbiology laboratory, and deploy the data visulization to GitHub webpage to publish it. So fellow researchers can access the webpage and interact with data with a drop-down menu to display different research results:
* A bar chart that displays the top 10 bacteria cultures found in the belly button.
* A gauge chart that shows the number of times a volunteer washes his/her belly button.
* A bubble chart that illustrates the amount of bacteria cultures per sample.
